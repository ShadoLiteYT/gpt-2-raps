exactly what happened","You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help","Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel","Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up","But the type of bullet that stuck","Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands","My plan's rather vindictive","Everybody's a victim in my eyes","When I ride it's a murderous rhythm","And outside became pitch black","A demon glued to my back, whispering \"Get 'em!\"","I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuck","That same mentality I told my brother not to duck","In actuality it's a trip how

but don't want to die yet","Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?","Fuck with me after my shift","Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit","Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit","That's every day shit","Shut the fuck up I don't want your conversation","Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation","My every day shit, every night shit, my every day shit","(Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)","All my night, been ready for you all my night","Been waiting on you all my night","I'll buzz you in just let me know when you outside","All my night, you been missing all my night","Still got some good nights memorized","And the look back's getting me right","Every night fucks every day up","Every day patches the night up","On God you should match it, it's that KO","No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up","1998 my family had that Acura","Oh, the Legend","Kept at least six discs in the changer","Back when Boswell and Percy had it active","Couple bishops in the city building mansions","All the reverends","Preaching self made millionaire status","When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion","After 'trina hit I had to transfer campus","Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited","Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address","Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress","Working on a way to make it outta Texas, every night","Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah","You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit","That kumbaya shit","Want to see nirvana, but don't want to die yet","Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by","Fuck with me after my shift","Know them boys wanna see me broke down","See me bummed out, stressed out","That's just everyday shit","Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation","Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation","My every day shit, my every day shit","My every day shit, my every day shit","My every day shit, my every day shit","My every day shit, my every night shit",""]}}
